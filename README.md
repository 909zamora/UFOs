# UFOs

### Overview of Project
This project utilized the data in a .json file that had a list of thousands of UFO sightings by "date, city, state, country, duration of sighting, shape, & comments". The idea was to build a website that linked a style.css, app.js & a data.js file so we could filter the table on the html website. The site also had styling and formatting to have a crisp look. With this website we transformed the data.js file from a list of thousands of variables that was hard to analyze to an easy to use filtered table based on user input!


### Results
In order to filter the table, you simply enter the text that you want to search for, this can be done in each subfilter, there are 5 filters provided, "date, city, state, country, shape". In the image here: (https://github.com/909zamora/UFOs/blob/main/static/images/Filters.PNG) we can see that I filtered by date and city and the only search results was the one from round rock on 1/10/2010. Easy!


### Summary
One of the drawbacks of this design is that the table is very messy when you first load the web page. All of the data loads before you even begin to filter and this is an overload of information for the user. I would suggest not showing a table until the user enters filters and instead display a message that reads "Filter the data by Date, city, state, country & shape of UFO in the filters to the left" But even then, it would be hard to find any trends on the data by simply filtering for random variables. It would be nice to show a chart that showed the dates, cities, states, countries & ufo shapes with the most activity! That way the end user can look for specific filters that have the most cases of UFO sightings.
